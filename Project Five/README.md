The final extension to the fish tank program. This program still allows users to add, remove, and move fish and decorations, along with controlling fish to swim.
However now added are different colors of fish, an option to clear the tank, and on-screen buttons for each of those options. 
This program utilized inheritance with the buttons and some more practice with PApplet.
