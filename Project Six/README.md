This project uses two different methods to crack a digit password between 1-1000 and then compare the two methods to decide which is more efficient (although it is clear which is more efficient beforehand, it's just a program to prove, and test knowledge)
The two methods include a "hack" method, and then a "brute force" method
The "hack" method just simply knows the password and will get it in the first guess complexity O(1), however, the "brute force" method instead tries to guess the password by literally counting up one by one until it reaches the password, with complexity of O(N)
Then using these two methods, compare them, and decide how much longer it takes for the "brute force" compared to the "hack"
This program just served as an intro to complexities, run time and algorithm efficiency.
