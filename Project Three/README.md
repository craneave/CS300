This project mainly was to learn and begin dealing with error handling, boundaries within a program, and testing a program.
This program utilizes exception and exception handling to deal with errors that arise from user input from the code. 
Along with this, also created a tester class that tests our code to ensure everything is working as needed. The tester class is designed to test different methods within our code to ensure that each method itself is dealing with exceptions, errors, and boundaries. Once all individual methods are tested, then the main for the tester class will return if all tests passed or failed.
