This project was used to practice, focus on, and visually work with objects and images within Java. This program uses PApplet, a base class for sketches within Java that require processing.
In the program you can add, remove, and drag fish images around a fish tank background, all processed using PApplet and Pimage.
This project helped a lot with learning how processing sketches and images works in Java.
