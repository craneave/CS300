This project was used to practice, focus on, and work with objects and images in a visual sense, within Java. This program uses PApplet which is a base class for sketches within Java that require processing.
In the program you can add, remove, and drag fish images around a fishtank background, all processed using PApplet and Pimage.
This project helped a lot with learning how processing sketches and images work in Java, along with a little bit of inheritance and utiliing Java's import.
