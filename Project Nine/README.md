This project also deals with data structures, as in this one utilizing a stack data structure.
This project serves as a little example of how using a stack structure would work and how it could be practical.
This stack structure uses the first-in-first-out method, and string digits can be added to stacks and the stacks are printed out to the console to be seen.
