This project uses recurrsion to search files in a directory by either file type, size, or name
A simple program to demonstrate the uses and how to use recursion in a practical way.
A tester class created as well to test all of the recursive methods, and their boundaries, to ensure no endless loops were created, and to confirm that the recursion was actually working.
