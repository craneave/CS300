This project takes the previous (project eight) implementation of our bookshelf program and turns it into a binary search tree versin of storing and accessing our books.
It uses nodes and node classes to access the left, right, parent, and child of each node, and also a tester class.
The tester class tests if accessing the nodes are done correctly, as well as storing them.
