This project was the first project I had ever completed for UW-Madison. There was most definetely a learning curve to adjust to in comparison to high school, but with enough time I caught along. This project essentially just served as an introduction or a refresher to Java programmning, and what it does is just tracks rock climbing scores or grades, will take in new rock climbing grades and returns some stats such as averages, sends, and fails. In terms of approaches taken, considering this was one of my first introductions to programming at this level, the code used a lot of simple arrays, if statements, a lot of redundancy, and definetely a few bugs. Was a great learning experience however.
